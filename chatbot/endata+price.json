In some clinical studies, severe attacks (rapid worsening shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, chest tightness that can lead to hospitalization) were observed. - Common side effects: headache, tremor, palpitations. - Uncommon side effects: agitation, anxiety, nervousness, sleeping troubles, dizziness, increased heartbeat, taste disorders, muscle cramps, muscle pain. - Rare side effects: throat irritation, bronchospasm. - Very rare side effects: nausea. Have also been reported allergic reactions, which can be serious, following the administration of the drug, which can be accompanied by swelling of the hands and / or feet (peripheral edema), swelling of the face, eyelids and lips, itching, skin rash or pressure drop. If you are sensitive to inhaled dry powder, it can occasionally appear irritation of the throat with cough or hoarseness; this can be prevented by rinsing the mouth after inhalation. If you experience muscle weakness, cramps or abnormal heartbeat, it may be a sign of too low potassium level in your blood. If you experience thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, this may be due to too much sugar in the blood. If you notice any side effects not listed in this leafiet, or if the side effects get serious, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.",

IF IN DOUBT, ASK YOUR DOCTOR OR YOUR PHARMACIST FOR ADVICE. Special warnings and precautions - This medicine may cause damage to the liver or pancreas may endanger the patientfls life. This can occur especially in the first 6 months of treatment. Tell your doctor immediately if you develop the following signs: - Sudden tiredness, loss of appetite, depression, drowsiness, leg swelling, general malaise; - Repeated vomiting, stomach pains, nausea, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice); - Reappearance of seizures while youflre following your treatment properly. Your doctor will decide on the need to prescribe you blood tests or to stop or change treatment. - Tell your doctor if you have kidney disease (kidney failure), systemic lupus erythematosus, hereditary enzyme deficiencies or genetic problem that is responsible for a mitochondrial disorder. - If you need surgery, tell the medical staff you are taking this medicine. - In the beginning of treatment, if you are a woman, the doctor must ensure that you are not pregnant and you have a means of contraception (see pregnancy section). - At the beginning of treatment, it is possible that seizure frequency increases or that different types of crises appear. Then consult your doctor immediately. - This drug may cause weight gain. Your doctor will give you dietary advice and monitor your weight. - If you have a deficiency of carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) type II (inherited metabolic disease), the risk of occurring serious muscle problems (rhabdomyolysis) with this drug will be more important. - Self-harming or killing thoughts were also observed in a small number of people being treated with antiepileptics such as Valoxine. If you have these thoughts, contact your doctor immediately. - Tell your doctor if your child is taking another antiepileptic drug or suffering from other neurological or metabolic disease and severe forms of epilepsy. Interactions with other drugs Other medicines and VALOXINE You should never take this medicine if you take: - Mefloquine (medicine to treat malaria) - St. Johnfls wort (medicine to treat depression). You must tell your doctor if you take: - Lamotrigine (medicine to treat epilepsy) - The penems (antibiotics to treat bacterial infections) Tell your doctor that your child takes this medicine, if prescribed aspirin or other medication derived from aspirin. INFORM YOUR DOCTOR OR YOUR PHARMACIST IF YOU ARE TAKING, HAVE RECENTLY TAKEN OR MAY TAKE ANY MEDICINE. Interactions with food and drinks VALOXINE with alcohol: Taking alcoholic beverages is not recommended during treatment by VALOXINE. Use during pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Important advice to the attention of women: If you are a woman of childbearing age, your doctor will prescribe you valproate only in case of failure of other treatments. Valproate is dangerous for the unborn child if taken during pregnancy. - Valproate expose to a risk if taken during pregnancy. The higher the dose is, the higher the risks are; however, all doses expose to this risk. - Children exposed in utero to valproate have high risks of severe birth malformations and developmental (mental and motor) and behavior disabilities. Reported malformations include spina bifida (bone deformity of the spine), malformations of the face, upper lip and palate, skull, heart, kidneys, urinary tract and genital organs and also members. - If you take valproate during pregnancy, you have a higher risk than other women to have a child with malformations requiring medical treatment. Since Valproate has been used for many years, it is established that almost 10% of children born to mothers under valproate have malformations, against 2-3% of children in the general population. - It is estimated that up to 30 to 40% of preschool children, whose mothers took valproate during pregnancy, have developmental problems in infancy. The children involved walk later and / or speak later, and / or have lower intellectual abilities than other children and / or have difficulty with language and / or memory. - The autism spectrum disorders are more often diagnosed in children exposed to valproate. - Limited data to date indicate that children are more likely to develop the symptoms of attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), when they are exposed to Valproate. - Before prescribing this drug, your specialist doctor will have you explained the possible risks to your child if you become pregnant while taking valproate. If later you are planning a pregnancy, you should not stop treatment without first talking with your doctor and agreed to further treatment if possible. - If you try to have a baby, ask your specialist about taking folic acid. Folic acid supplementation before pregnancy may reduce the risk of closure of neural tube malformations and early miscarriage. However, prevention of malformations related to valproate by folic acid is not proven to date. FIRST-PRESCRIPTION If this is the first time you have been prescribed valproate your doctor will have explained the risks to an unborn child if you become pregnant. Once you are of childbearing age, you will need to make sure you use an effective method of contraception throughout your treatment. Talk to your doctor or family planning clinic if you need advice on contraception. Key messages: -Make sure you are using an effective method of contraception. -Tell your doctor at once if you are pregnant or think you might be pregnant. CONTINUING TREATMENT AND NOT TRYING FOR A BABY If you are continuing treatment with valproate but you donflt plan to have a baby make sure you are using an effective method of contraception. Talk to your doctor or family planning clinic if you need advice on contraception. Key messages: -Make sure you are using an effective method of contraception. -Tell your doctor at once if you are pregnant or think you might be pregnant. CONTINUING TREATMENT AND CONSIDERING TRYING FOR A BABY If you are continuing treatment with valproate and you are now thinking of trying for a baby you must not stop taking either your valproate or your contraceptive medicine until you have discussed this with your prescriber. You should talk to your doctor well before you become pregnant so that you can put several actions in place so that your pregnancy goes as smoothly as possible and any risks to you and your unborn child are reduced as much as possible. Your doctor may decide to change the dose of valproate or switch you to another medicine before you start trying for a baby. If you do become pregnant you will be monitored very closely both for the management of your underlying condition and to check how your unborn child is developing. Ask your doctor about taking folic acid when trying for a baby. Folic acid can lower the general risk of spina bifida and early miscarriage that exists with all pregnancies. However, it is unlikely that it will reduce the risk of birth defects associated with valproate use. Key messages: -Do not stop using your contraception before you have talked to your doctor and worked together on a plan to ensure your bipolar is controlled and the risks to your baby are reduced -Tell your doctor at once when you know or think you might be pregnant. UNPLANNED PREGNANCY WHILST CONTINUING TREATMENT Babies born to mothers who have been on valproate are at serious risk of birth defects and problems with development which can be seriously debilitating. If you are taking valproate and you think you are pregnant or might be pregnant contact your doctor at once. Do not stop taking your medicine until your doctor tells you to. Ask your doctor about taking folic acid. Folic acid can lower the general risk of spina bifida and early miscarriage that exists with all pregnancies.
